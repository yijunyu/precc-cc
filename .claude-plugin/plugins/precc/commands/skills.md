description: List all PRECC automation skills and their activation stats
---

Run `precc skills list` and display the output to the user. This shows all registered automation skills (both built-in and mined), their priority, enabled status, and activation statistics.

If the user provides "$ARGUMENTS", pass it as a subcommand. For example:
- `precc skills list` — list all skills
- `precc skills show <name>` — show details of a specific skill
